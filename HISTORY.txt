# HISTORY FILE

version 1.02, 01-19-2016
----------------------
+ moved cookie saving to http class

version 1.01, 01-03-2016
----------------------
+ added SESSION caching to file: we save the 'access_token' in a writable location.  Default is to save to /tmp/ directory, which gets deleted upon reboot.  Ideally, create a local directory (ex: ./cache), give it the correct permissions and save file there.

version 1.00, 10-21-2015
----------------------
+ initial commit.
